        <p class="text-[0.8rem] leading-8 text-justify indent-10 mt-4 p-10">
          I grew up in a humble home with three siblings, a young mother in her twenties, and an older father in his sixties. Our early years were guided by the firm but caring hand of our strict Lola which also later passed away, teaching us to be disciplined and respectful. When I was in nursery, my father suffered a stroke that left him disabled, and my mother was suddenly left to carry the burden alone. She became our sole provider, working hard to support us, while we learned to become more independent at school and at home. Life was busy and sometimes hard, but it taught us resilience and self-reliance at a young age. Despite the challenges, I found joy in simple things — especially playing with my childhood friends who lived just next door. As I got older, I made more friends in the barangay and loved exploring the neighborhood, swimming in the river, and playing basketball. I spent a lot of time outdoors, wandering from shop to shop and enjoying the freedom of youth. At school, I began to feel the pressure to perform, especially with two older siblings who excelled academically. My childhood, though marked by hardship, was also filled with play, friendship, and the early sparks of independence.

        <p class="text-[0.8rem] leading-8 text-justify indent-10 mt-4  p-10">
          My teenage years were a time of discovery, growth, and deep reflection. I had more freedom, spent more time with friends, and often hung out at computer shops where I picked up new interests. I became more self-aware during this stage, learning how to navigate friendships, responsibilities, and my own emotions. I got more involved in school activities — editing videos, leading group work, and focusing more on academics. But the pandemic changed everything; I dropped out of school in Grade 11, only to rise again by transferring and continuing my education elsewhere. One of the hardest moments was in 2023, when I lost my first and best childhood friend — a pain that shook me deeply. That loss, along with my other struggles, taught me how fragile and valuable life is. I started a small business with support from my mom and a few friends, something that gave me strength and purpose during uncertain times. Though I sometimes felt like a burden to my family, I slowly learned how to be more responsible. My teenage years shaped me not just mentally, but emotionally and spiritually — they were a turning point where I truly began to grow into myself.

        <h1 class="text-[1rem] text-center">My early adulthood</h1>
        <p class="text-[0.8rem] leading-8 text-justify indent-10 mt-4  p-10">
          As I entered young adulthood, I began to understand myself more deeply — my personality, my patterns, and the balance between maturity and lingering immaturity. I’ve become more capable of handling adult responsibilities, though I still struggle at times with laziness and occasional clashes with my family, often due to miscommunication rather than real conflict. Despite that, we remain close, and I continue to serve as a caregiver for my father, a role I’ve embraced since my late teens. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, grateful to be on the path toward a career I’m genuinely passionate about. The pressure to succeed grows stronger each day, not just for myself, but because I want to uplift my family and build a meaningful future of my own. One of the greatest blessings during this time has been meeting my girlfriend in my first year of college — we’re now entering our third year together, growing and supporting each other. Spiritually, my connection with Jesus has deepened, with His life and teachings becoming a guiding philosophy for me. This spiritual journey, which began in my early teens, now shapes how I see the world and live my life. Health-wise, I’m hoping to get back to exercising, as I once did when I started going to the gym, with the goal of becoming stronger both inside and out. As I look ahead, I remain hopeful — determined to make my dreams a reality and build a life filled with purpose, love, and lasting success.
